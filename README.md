# TG-U1 Firmware
Designed for the [TG -U1](https://github.com/TeagueGillard/TG-U1)

It does not have all features yet, but has basic inputs and LED control with SimHardware and SimHub.

Basic inputs work, but more complex inputs (Rotary Switches, Rotary Encoders, Dual Clutches, 7-Way Switches, etc) will come with the next version!
